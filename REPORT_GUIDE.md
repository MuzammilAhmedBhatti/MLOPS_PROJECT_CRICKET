# Cricket Shot Detection - Project Report Guide

## LaTeX Report Created

Your comprehensive project report has been generated as `cricket_shot_detection_report.tex`

### How to Use with Overleaf

1. **Upload to Overleaf:**
   - Go to https://www.overleaf.com
   - Create a new blank project
   - Upload the `cricket_shot_detection_report.tex` file
   - Upload your methodology diagram from `app/static/uploads/cricket-shot-detection.png`

2. **Compile the Document:**
   - Overleaf will automatically compile the LaTeX
   - The PDF will be generated in the view pane
   - Report is formatted for 5-7 pages as required
